This is a preamplifier circuit for a bass-amp, using much of [Rod Elliot's design](https://sound-au.com/project152-1.htm) over at Sound Au, with some changes:

* The EQ board is broken off into a separate board, so that the main preamp design could be used with different EQ schems (graphic, etc.)
* I skipped adding a compressor, though this can probably be added immediately after the EQ chain if needed.

Since Chinese PCB fabrication is dramatically cheaper if your design is 100x100mm or smaller, this design is broken up into separate boards for the preamp, linear power supply (+/-12V), and EQ stages.
